README 
this README is an attempt to explain what the analysis files did. 
This data is tidy because: 

- Ensured there was one variable per row.
- Ensured that each variable was in one column.
- Each column has a variable name.
 
What are the descriptive names given  to the variables?
the descriptive names given to the variables can be divided into 5 parts
for example:
"tBodyAcc.correlation...Y.Z" 
"tGravityAcc.mean...X" 

Domain -  t is times which is the Domain
Signal Type - Acceleration and Gyration is the Sensor Signal Type
Measurement Type - correlation is the measurement type among others like mean and standard deviation.
Axis - is either X, Y or Z
Average value - <the value>
X 
Y is the activities performed















Why are these names descriptive?
